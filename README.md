# Filmophile

<i>Filmophile</i>: Film lover. Usually higher-class movies or classic movies of any genre.

This site takes movies and TV shows from different streaming services and makes them all available in one place. The user votes on their favorite and disliked movies, and the computer model learns their preferences from that information. The model then makes recommendations for new movies in three types: Love It, Maybe, and Don't Bother. This is a continuing project that combines three of my passions: data science, web development, and movies.

This project was first created under the FlatIron School's Data Science Bootcamp, for the Capstone project.

## Results

The project is still ongoing. Current work is on deploying the site to AWS. The next step is to setup bulk scraping so getting movie data can be automated. SVM proves to be the best algorithm for recommendations, and will continue to be improved. The next step in improving the algorithm is using NLP for cosine similarity of the Synopsis feature.


## Methodology

The methodology is explained on one of the website's pages, whose deployment is a currently being worked on.
