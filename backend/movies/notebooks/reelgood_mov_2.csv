His thought was born in the hole of solitary confinement, apart from time and beyond the grasp of society. In his cell, he created his own world and speaks his own language: he has concluded that there is only the mind. From convincing his followers to move into the desert to train for the apocalypse, to leading a murderous crew through a string of devilish murders, you will see and hear from Manson himself of how he created a preconceived terror based on his philosophy of life. Manson claims that the so-called 'straight' world outside of prison is but an inverted reflection of the underworld in which he has lived. To him, the reality that presidents and law-abiding citizens accept begins in the hermetic alternate universe of criminals, cons and outlaws.","{""reelgood"": ""charles-manson-superstar-1989"", ""amazon"": ""B07CF4T47K""}"

Under his control, Congo became a gulag labour camp of shocking brutality. Leopold posed as the protector of Africans fleeing Arab slave-traders but, in reality, he carved out an empire based on terror to harvest rubber.  From the mid-1880s and lasting for nearly 40 years, an estimated 10 million Congolese were killed under Leopold's reign. The madness only came to an end thanks to the efforts of British journalist and humanitarian E.D. Morel, who exposed the human rights abuses in Congo and published photographs of the mutilated Congolese.","{""reelgood"": ""congo-white-king-red-rubber-black-death-2004"", ""amazon"": ""B00MTDCUOK""}"

This time, he carries a badge but his character hasn't lost his distaste for double-dealing bosses and authority figures who are out to cover their own butts.  Detective Kuno is balanced between the law and pragmatism. Cops didn't enforce the law to the point of pushing gangsters over the edge. In return, the gangsters mostly stayed out of the public eye. Some of them even became friends with cops, sharing a mutual desire to keep-down trade unions and leftists. When that balance is upset, Kuno has to decide where his loyalties lie. In this gray world, cops aren't always good and gangsters are thoroughly bad.. although there's no reward for good men who drink from the cup of corruption.  ""Cops Versus Thugs"" has that trademark Fukasaku camera-work.. constantly moving, zooming, and putting you right in the middle of the action, changing loyalties and political maneuvering between cops and criminals.","{""reelgood"": ""cops-vs-thugs-1975"", ""amazon"": ""B07643JZ7R""}"

It looks simple enough; a 100-watt light bulb, a motor, and a rotating cylinder with cutouts. Just sit in front of it, close your eyes, and wait for the visions to come. The Dream Machine enthralled mystics and freethinkers everywhere; Kurt Cobain had a dream machine, and William S. Burroughs thought it could be used to “storm the citadels of enlightenment.” With a custom-made Dream Machine in tow, director Nik Sheehan takes us on a journey into the life of Brion Gysin; his art, his complex ideas, and his friendships with some of the most eccentric counter-cultural icons. Taking the Dream Machine as the basis of its explorations, FLicKeR asks crucial questions about the nature of art and consciousness, and imagines a humanity liberated to explore its creativity in complete freedom.","{""reelgood"": ""flicker-2009"", ""amazon"": ""B07CZ9K94N""}"

Between the archival scenes and contemporary interviews with band members, the DVD shows a band making seismic inroads in pop music--and five young guys coming to terms with artistry, mortality, and, yes, the pursuit of happiness. There is priceless footage of Neal Cassady driving Ken Kesey's bus and of the Dead, surrounded by martini-sipping hipsters, on Playboy After Dark. The best scenes involve band members talking about specific songs (you will never hear Phil Lesh's ""Box of Rain"" again without thinking of it as a gift to his dying father) or deconstructing a tune by playing each track separately. Intimate and surprisingly cohesive, Anthem to Beauty is a rare glimpse into how the Dead's magic was made.","{""reelgood"": ""the-grateful-dead-anthem-to-beauty-1997"", ""amazon"": ""B07JXS3WYL""}"

Scrambling to get his idea to market and bring financial security to his family, Josh applies for a US Patent. Suddenly, his plans of success are blindsided when his genius idea is stolen by a big company before he can make his first dime! Thrust into a battle to save his invention he uncovers the shocking truth that our patent system is weakening, property rights are at risk and American Innovation is dying!  Interviews with experts like former Attorney General, Ed Meese, Inventor and Congressional Representative, Thomas Massie, Antonin Scalia Law Professor and IP expert Adam Mossoff provide shocking information about the state of the weakening US Patent system. Other inventors share their stories of theft, patent invalidation and difficulty finding investors for their patented innovations. Ken Blackwell, Leonard Leo, Dr. Matthew Spalding and conservative leader Dan Schneider all provide valuable insights into how the current system is harming Americans and the American innovation economy. With theft of US intellectual property by China topping $600 billion per year, other countries are profiting off the ideas and labor of American inventors. Big tech companies are finding it easier and cheaper to infringe on patents rather than pay the patent owners. With an administrative tribunal pulling patents back from inventors, there is no safe place to bring an invention to the marketplace in America and our innovation is going overseas. The United States once led the world in new medications, new technology, and new ideas. American inventors and their inventions touched the lives of people in every country, of every race and every language. But our weakening Patent system is INVALIDATING their property rights – and with it, their incentive to create. Money and inventions are now going to other countries, and with them go jobs and a strong economy.  Building something and owning it IS the American Dream, but without a strong patent system, the American Dream will be invalidated!","{""reelgood"": ""invalidated-2018"", ""amazon"": ""B07G2T6YV1""}"

Ditch, their self appointed king, is an irascible son-of-a-bitch with a Napoleon complex, and his pals love him for it. Until one day he pushes the self-tenured Professor too far. A game of threats, posturing and sexual ploys lead them down a dark but comic road in this exploration of what it is to be a man today. Filmed in black and white, this richly textured character study could be the bastard child of Woody Allen and Tom Waits, brought to life by an ensemble of real-life character actors who have known each other and worked together for over twenty- five years.","{""reelgood"": ""king-of-herrings-2014"", ""amazon"": ""B00XVRL1B6""}"

The blues was first played by itinerant musicians in juke joints on the edge of cotton plantations, later migrating into so-called urban lounges, and regional musicians still practice their craft and entertain their fans in both, as well as in modern blues clubs and casino lounges. The film focuses, in particular, on two well-known Mississippi venues: Jimmy King's legendary Subway Lounge which, for three decades, operated in the basement of the historic, black-owned Summers Hotel in Jackson, Mississippi; and actor Morgan Freeman's and attorney Bill Luckett's Ground Zero Blues Club, a contemporary blues venue in Clarksdale, Mississippi that incorporates the design elements, menu and spirit of a traditional juke. The story of Mississippi jukes is told by blues historians Dick Waterman and Steve Cheseborough, by the club owners, by local politicians and by participating musicians. The musicians also demonstrate styles of blues that originated in the Mississippi Delta and elsewhere around the state. For instance, performing at Ground Zero Blues Club in Clarksdale are Alvin Youngblood Hart with Sam Carr and Anthony Sherrod. Performing at the Subway Lounge in Jackson are Bobby Rush, Chris Thomas King, Vasti Jackson, Patrice Moncell, Eddie Cotton, Greg ""Fingers"" Taylor, Lucille, Abdul Rasheed, Levon Lindsey, J.T. Watkins, Dennis Fountain, Pat Brown, George Jackson, Steve Cheseborough, Casey Phillips, Jimmy King, David Hughes, Virgil Brawley and the Subway's two alternating house bands: the House Rockers and the King Edward Blues Band. LAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI JUKES looks at the buildings, the landscapes, and the communities where the blues began, and it examines how original blues traditions have evolved over time, carried into a new century by committed musicians and club owners, both in Mississippi and around the world.","{""reelgood"": ""last-of-the-mississippi-jukes-2003"", ""amazon"": ""B07MKJPGBS""}"
