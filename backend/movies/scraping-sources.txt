SCRAPING SOURCES

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime
- these are the streaming services themselves
- scraping them isn't an option because you have to search the service
   - there's no guarantee you'll get all titles available anyway
   - there's no way to scrape just movies

IMDb
- best source of data for each movie
- has many data elements, good genres, directors, even buget sometimes
   - genres are in alphabetical order

ReelGood
- great source for movies/series for every streaming service
   - once one scraper is written, they are all written
- streaming id's are available, but require following a link per movie   
- has great data, year, rating, syopsis, country, director
   + has genres (order is dubious), imdb score, RT score, tags
   - no actor (has full list), metascore, budget
- has 3800 movies for netflix
- somehow has prime paid movies for free

JustWatch
- source for movies/series for every streaming service
- streaming ids are completely obfuscated
- has 3700 movies for netflix

What's On Netflix
- decent source for netflix only, separates by movie, series, documentary
- netflix id's are readily available
- doesn't have many data elements
- has 2900 netflix movies
