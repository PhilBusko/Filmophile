Is it the biggest hoax or... the most important story in human history? You'll find the startling answer in this remarkable, true-life story about how a young Swiss boy's meetings with extraterrestrials would eventually lead him later in life through dozens of countries, meeting many famous world leaders - including Saddam Hussein - in order to fulfill ancient prophecies. This one-armed farmer from Switzerland has taken hundreds of the most startling photos in UFO History and has even filmed what he refers to as ""Beam Ships"" used by sentient beings that hail from a star system near the Pleiades. He has been able to produce photographs, film footage, sound recordings and even metal samples as evidence of his visitations. You'll be captivated by how in his twenties, ""Billy"" Eduard Albert Meier was transformed into ""The Phantom"" (a real life combination of Indiana Jones, Lawrence of Arabia and Hans Solo) and by packing a .44 Magnum was able to apprehend serial killers and mass murderers. Meier's life story is an enigmatic journey that ultimately culminates with him becoming the messenger for an advanced race of beings known as the Plejaran. Their message is clear: earth is in trouble, the people have been asleep, and we must make drastic changes or there will be devastating consequences for all of mankind. Is this story real or too incredible for us to grasp? You must decide for yourself, but if it's a hoax, why has Meier been the target of 21 assassination attempts? Could it be that the message that humanity so desperately needs to hear is not welcome by many of our world leaders?

With Winterbottom providing his signature ingenuity and pinpoint directorial control, they generate a riveting, boisterous, and, at times, cathartic riff on the extreme disparities between the haves and have nots in contemporary society.","{""reelgood"": ""the-emperors-new-clothes-2015"", ""amazon"": ""B071JWNPDG""}"

Trapped in a concrete bunker with seven other Green Berets and surrounded by a determined enemy using tanks for the first time in the war, Longgrear retreated to a corner of the shattered bunker and prayed his first real prayer. He knew death would come for him, so he prayed that God would take care of his wife and child. He counted his last 19 rounds of ammunition. Eighteen were for the enemy. The last was for him. Longgrear miraculously survived the battle, but he knew his life would never be the same - because he had to leave a man behind. The Man Left Behind chronicles the return of U.S. Army Col. (Ret.)

He also feels physically and emotionally isolated. There, he bonds primarily with two townsfolk. Harris Montgomery sees Max as an obvious choice to espouse the politics of socialism. And Alice Field sees in Max a person like herself: being a British war bride, she is an alien in a harsh environment. Alice is in an unsatisfying marriage and turns to Max for emotional support. As Max goes through his first year in Willowgreen, he learns to understand life in a rural prairie town, both from the viewpoint of his students and for his own benefit.","{""reelgood"": ""why-shoot-the-teacher-1977"", ""amazon"": ""B002KOTW1C""}"
