In 1517, power was in the hands of the few, thought was controlled by the chosen, and common people lived lives without hope. On October 31 of that year, a penniless monk named Martin Luther sparked the revolution that would change everything.  He had no army. In fact, he preached nonviolence so powerfully that — 400 years later — Michael King would change his name to Martin Luther King to show solidarity with the original movement.  This movement, the Protestant Reformation, changed Western culture at its core, sparking the drive toward individualism, freedom of religion, women's rights, separation of church and state, and even free public education. Without the Reformation, there would have been no pilgrims, no Puritans, and no America in the way we know it.","{""reelgood"": ""martin-luther-the-idea-that-changed-the-world-2017"", ""netflix"": ""80217436""}"

His new wild family is made up of mule deer living high in the mountains near his home in Wyoming, and the extraordinary story of how he became one of them pushes once again at the boundaries of how we perceive wild animals. A chance encounter with a young buck and a shared look of understanding grows into a study of these animals that takes up seven years of Hutto's life.  Ordinarily, mule deer would flee in panic at the sight of any human but he finds himself drawn to them and willingly dedicates himself to earning their trust by spending time with the herd every day for over two years.  Incredibly, these keenly intelligent animals eventually accept this stranger as one of their own.  Their acceptance allows him to enter deer society, to cross a species divide.  Walking among them, he is even groomed by them, and can lie with a pregnant doe talking to her unborn fawns.  The joy Hutto feels as he comes to know each individual is nothing short of infectious, but this human predator also learns to see the world from the point of view of prey, an experience that will ultimately rock him to his very core.","{""reelgood"": ""nature-touching-the-wild-living-with-the-mule-deer-of-deadman-gulch-2014"", ""amazon"": ""B00K1WHNNO""}"
